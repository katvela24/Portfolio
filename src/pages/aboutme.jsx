<h2> About Me</h2>

<p className="description">

  Katherine credits her love for learning and her deep curiosity in languages as the reason for signing up to this
  Full Stack Coding Bootcamp.

  Currently, she is working as a Business Developer for Kappa Design Studio, a family-owned small business and is
  overseeing the construction administration of different projects.

  Outside of work, you can find Katherine daydreaming about Galapagos and the beach, the next World Cup, or
  planning her next trip.

  Fun Fact: She attended weekly Society of Hispanic Engineer meetings at Rutgers and was one of the few
  non-engineers to be awarded member of the year.
